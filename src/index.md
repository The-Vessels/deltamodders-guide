# Welcome to the Deltamodder's guide!

Here are the current guides we have on this website:

- **[Getting started with deltamodding](getting-started)**:
    This tutorial teaches you how to get started from stage zero.

- **[The inner workings of DELTARUNE](inner-workings)**:
    This guide is meant to document the code that makes our favorite game work.

- **[GameMaker's Secrets](gamemaker)**:
    Have you ever wanted to know how the GameMaker engine that Deltarune and countless other games
    runs on works, and how tools like [UndertaleModTool](https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool)
    are able to parse GameMaker games? Well, you have come to the right place!
