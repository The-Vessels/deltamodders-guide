# Getting Started

[It seems like the page you've been looking for is under construction.]

[The Universe has notified me that it probably will not be finished for a very long time.]

[But that is where YOU come in, stardust!]

[You could be helping me out with this website instead of just sitting there and dwelling on loops.]

[Take a break from your adventure and help a friend out, won't you?]

        I'm not your friend, we only met two hundred and twenty-five loops ago.

        Sure, I can help you and contribute to <a href="https://github.com/The-Vessels/deltamodders-guide">the repository</a>!

    I'm sorry for trying to roleplay as loop
    from the indie game "In Stars and Time".
    I just love that game way too much though.
